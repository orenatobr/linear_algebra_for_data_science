# Linear Algebra for Data Science

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating key **Linear Algebra** concepts applied to **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**. The focus is on **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, variance, and covariance matrix, with practical implementations in Python using ```NumPy``` and ```scikit-learn```.

## 📂 Contents

📘 **Jupyter Notebooks:** Hands-on examples and explanations of core linear algebra concepts.

📊 **PCA Demonstration:** Dimensionality reduction with visualization of handwritten digits dataset.

📈 **Variance & Covariance:** Understanding feature relationships before applying PCA.

🛠️ **Python Libraries:** ```NumPy```, ```Matplotlib```, ```Pandas```, ```scikit-learn```.
